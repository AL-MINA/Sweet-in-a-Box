        <section id="history">
            <h3 class="history_h1">History of Baking</h3>
            <p class="about_p">The history of baking can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with the first evidence of bread-making dating to around 14,000 years ago. The process of baking has evolved significantly over time, from early methods involving flatbreads cooked on hot stones to the development of ovens and leavened bread in ancient Egypt. The Romans refined baking techniques, and during the Middle Ages, baking became a respected profession in Europe. The introduction of baking powder in the 19th century revolutionized baking, allowing for the creation of cakes, cookies, and other sweet treats. Today, baking is both a culinary art and a science, with a rich history that has shaped the way we enjoy baked goods.</p>
